you might know minecraft. well this is for minecraft. if you want to install the datapack, go onto the world file you want the pack enabled in and press
edit. then click on "open world folder". then open the folder "datapacks" then you paste the "arrows+ datapack" folder there. finally, once you loaded
the world, you click ESC, then you click OPTIONS, then RESOURCE PACKS, then you paste the "arrows+ resourcepack" folder there. then you go back to 
minecraft and select the arrows+ resourcepack. now you're good to go!
